# Continual Learning Interpretability:  Analysis of Adversial Attacks and Defense 

Implementation of a saliency map-based interpretability algorithm for use with the Incremental Task-Agnostic
Meta-learning Approach (iTAML) and Random Path Selection for Incremental Learning (RPS), and Deep Generative
Replay with and without distillation.

[//]: # (Short Description of Algorithm)

This code provides an implemenation of a novel continual learning interpretability algorithm which utilizes 
saliency maps. This repository contains implementations for iTAML, RPSnet, DGR, and DGR with distillation. 
The algorithm was implemented using PyTorch.

## Installation & Requirements
This code was has been tested using `Python 3.6.8` on a CentOS operating system.
